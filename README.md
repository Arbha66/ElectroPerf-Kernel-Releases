About Kernel Variants
=====================

```bash
- R-WIFI = Kernel With Wifi Drivers from CAF-R tag of LA.UM.9.2.r1-02700-SDMxx0.0.
- P-WIFI = Kernel With Wifi Drivers from CAF-P tag of LA.UM.7.2.r1-09400-sdm660.0.
```

Note
====

```bash
- Incase you face any bugs report with proper logs.
- R-WIFI variant needs Q firmware to give fast wifi speeds if you have a connection of more than 40mbps.
  Else it wont make any difference if you are on Pie Firmware.
- Check commit history for changelogs.
- There wont be any UC, UV variant or messed up display refresh rate variant.
- The released variants are little bit OC'ed to avoid the UI LAGS AND APP OPENING STUTTERS.
- Only Android R is supported as it isnt tested on Android Q or P till now.
```
